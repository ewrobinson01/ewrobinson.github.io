<p>Academics</p>
<p>Overall, I have kept a fairly positive academic standing. I am usually an A-B student, and often get good grades in my classes. I have gotten a handful of awards from Civil air patrol and NJROTC. I have received the Mitchell award, marking C/2ndLt in Civil air patrol, as well as an award from the Daughters of the American Revolution, alongside a scholastic excellence award for NJROTC.&nbsp;</p>
