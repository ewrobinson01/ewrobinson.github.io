<p>&nbsp;I like to make models of planes and tanks and such. The one I had the most fun creating was an F-14D bought by my Dad. Some models also come from tabletop games I like to play. Flames of War/Team Yankee is a good example. Battletech is probably my most favorite to play. Primarily because itâ€™s mechanics are so unique and feel realistic.</p>
<p>My favorite model (CFA-44 Nosferatu):&nbsp;</p>
