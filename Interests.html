<p>&nbsp;My dreams</p>
<p>I am incredibly passionate about flying, and aircraft in general. This is one of the reasons that I joined the Civil Air Patrol. Since then, I have had 3 Orientation flights, 4 Glider flights, and might be going to a flight academy later this Year. It is my dream to become a pilot in the Air Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, Orientation flights are, in my opinion, the most fun. Some of my friends would probably disagree (Some people just aren't interested in that kinda stuff). In an orientation flight, you meet up with an instructor, who will take off for you. After that, you have some freedom to do what you want. In some cases, you will have a small class on the operation of the aircraft (such as one time I was taught AOA stalls). Though sometimes they just let you fly around a little and appreciate the experience. Eventually the instructor lands the plane, and passes control off to the next cadet.</p>
